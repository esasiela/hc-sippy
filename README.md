## hc-sippy

The doctors tell me it is a good idea to hydrate my human body by sipping liquids all day long, rather than chugging a liter of water in one go.

The trouble is I get deep into whatever I'm doing and forget to sip.

In comes HC Sippy, a little device that reminds me to take a sip and tracks my progress through the day.

Like all my favorite projects, this one involves:

* Arduino compatible (Adafruit ProTrinket) controller

* Wooden enclosure to make it rugged, compact, and pretty

* CAD design in Eagle (circuitry) and Fusion 360 (enclosure)
